Problem with Water Sensor Dut to Water Quality and Impuirty

The project is a automatic watering system for animals which can be used domestically or in industry. It consists of an ultrasnoic sensor and a water sensor. There should be a minimum level of water in the pot all the time and when ever an animal is detected in 50 cm is the pot, water starts to flow. The water is stoppped when an anmial moves away or when the water reaches the maximum level. The data is transmitted to Adafruit to observe the water level in real time and observe the flow of water for leaked and any other such problem.
